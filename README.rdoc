= portal

Portal is a command-line application that controls configuring your .ssh/config
for ssh hosts to programmatically add default host information.  It reads the
file and auto-loads any hosts you have manually configured so you will not lose
anything done manually.

*NOTE*: It currently does not respect anything else in the config file and will
blow it away.  This a going to be resolved shortly.
